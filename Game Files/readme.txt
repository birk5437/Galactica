if you go into the music file....you can type in the file name of the sound file you want to play as the background music.....the number underneath the sound file is the volume.......i think its like 1 to 100 but im not really sure so just mess around with it if you want.


**if you just exit while the game is still going on.....the high score will not be set....so if you want to quit and then set the high score...then just run into enemies and die :-D
